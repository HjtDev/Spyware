This repository contains Python projects that I've created as part of the https://sabzlearn.ir/course/applied-projects-with-python/ taught by Reza Dolati(https://github.com/rezadolati01). These projects are educational in nature and designed to demonstrate various Python concepts and applications.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Reza Dolati(https://github.com/rezadolati01) and the https://sabzlearn.ir/course/applied-projects-with-python/ for providing the foundational knowledge and inspiration for these projects. The original course material can be found at Instructor's GitHub.

## Disclaimer

The projects in this repository are for educational purposes only and are not intended for malicious use. They are based on concepts taught in the https://sabzlearn.ir/course/applied-projects-with-python/, and I have adapted them for my own learning and portfolio display.
